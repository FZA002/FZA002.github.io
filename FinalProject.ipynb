    "# First, some background...\n",
    "Conor McGregor. Quite a polarizing name to most. For those of you who don't know, Conor McGregor is an irish mixed martial artist currently competing in the Ultimate Fighting Competition (UFC). He is the former featherweight (145lbs) and lightweight (155lbs) champion, and is the first ever competitor in UFC history to have been a champion in two weight classes simultaneously. He is widely regarded as the most influential mixed martial artist ever, and is recognized for his massive role in catapulting MMA onto the global stage. Conor's rise to fame not only came from skill that was ahead of his time, but his immense confidence and trash talking that came with it. He earned the nickname \"The Mystic Mac\" after predicting many of his victories down to the round and method of victory. As you can imagine, this gained him a boatload of fans very quickly, and made his brand expand outside of just MMA. Further reading on Conor is available at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor"

    "In recent years, Conor has changed in many ways. Money, fame, and a huge ego have put him in a completely different position then when he started competing in MMA. As time has gone on, many factors have changed, not only relating to his lifestyle, but also in MMA. Fighters have become more well-rounded since McGregor's meteoric rise, where as Conor has mostly stuck to his traditional, hands-low, karate style of fighting, which is part of his appeal to fans. In this project, my goal is to try and use data science to better understand factors that may have had an affect upon his performance. I will explore many different factors, each as their own section. Many people argue that he is now \"washed up\", while his fans (myself included) hope that he may one day snag UFC gold again."

    "# The Data\n",
    "The data I will use will only be on fights in the UFC. It's worth noting that of Conor's record of 22 wins and 6 losses, only the 14 most recent of those fights were in the UFC. The internet has very conveniently blessed the world with http://ufcstats.com/statistics/events/completed. This website has detailed statistics on every fighter and fight that has taken place in the UFC. It has statistics on a fighter as a whole, on specific fights, and even specific rounds of fights. It allows us to see how many strikes a fighter lands, their accuracy, where the strikes landed, how many takedowns they land or go for, and much more."

    "Below is the code I used to grab the intial data from ufcstats page on Conor. The table that I extracted with pandas lists all of Conor's fights, along with a few major data points on these. These points include: whether Conor won or lost, who he fought, # of knockdowns by both fighters, # of significant strikes landed by both fighters, # of takedowns attempted by both fighters, # of submissions attempted by both fighters, the name of the event, date of the event, what round the fight finished in, and at what time of that round the fight finished at."

    "# Factor 1: Pay per Fight\n",
    "It's no surprise that as McGregor's popularity grew, so did his paychecks. Conor started at a mere 8,000 dollars to show up to fight, and an additional $8,000 to win. Don't forget, that's before taxes as well as paying his fighting team. This was also before he earned numerous, lucrative sponsorships and started many of his own businesses, which have only further fattened his pockets. I was able to find his pay (excluding additional earnings from Pay-per-view percentages) for each fight in the UFC from https://thesportsdaily.com/2021/07/11/conor-mcgregor-career-earnings-fox11/. Is the saying, \"It’s tough to get out of bed to do roadwork at 5am when you’ve been sleeping in silk pajamas\" true for Conor? Or has the money not gotten to his head in terms of performance. Let's find out."
